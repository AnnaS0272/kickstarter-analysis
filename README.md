### An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

This data analysis project is prepared to assist playwrite Louise on selecting the most effective strategy for her campaign by revealing trends and insights from the past Kickstarter campaigns data. Louise wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play Fever; her estimated budget is $10,000. The analysis is completed using MS Excel analytical tools such as PivotTable, PivotChart, VLOOKUP, Descriptive Statistics and COUNTIFS.

Let's start by looking at the overall summary of Kickstarter campaign data visualized by the Parent Category. The data is quickly revealing that *theater/plays* category is the most popular in the United States.

We further examine the relationship of plays with other subcategories within the United States. Plays are very popular amongst all subcategories and, seemingly, have a high success rate. That's certainly good news for Louise as she is preparing to campaign in this subcategory. But we can also see that failure rates are pretty high too, accounting for almost a half of all plays. Given such dynamics, we need to better understand what makes a theatrical play campaign successful.

If we examine whether the month of the year makes any impact on the success of the campaign, it is obvious that campaigns started in May are the most successful. It is likely connected with the upcoming summer break, more relaxed schedules and as a result the picking up interest of the public in attending cultural events such as plays.


* ***Recommendation No. 1 - Plan to start your campaign in May.***
