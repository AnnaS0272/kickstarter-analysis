### An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

This data analysis project is prepared to assist playwrite Louise on selecting the most effective strategy for her campaign. Louisw wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play Fever; her estimated budget is $10,000. The project is focused on revealing trends and insights from the past Kickstarter campaigns data in order to improve outcomes of future campaigns by providing data driven recommendations.  The analysis is completed using MS Excel analytical tools such as PivotTable, PivotChart, VLOOKUP, Descriptive Statistics and COUNTIFS functionalitites.

Let's start by looking at the overall summary of Kickstarter campaign data visualized by the Parent Category. The data is quickly revealing that *theater/plays* category is the most popular in the United States.

We further examine the relationship of plays with other subcategories within the United States. Plays are very popular and, seemingly, have a high success rate. That's certainly good news for Louise as she is preparing to campaign in this subcategory. But we can also see that failure rates are pretty high too, accounting for almost a half of all plays. Given such dynamics, we need to better understand what makes a theatrical play campaign successful.
